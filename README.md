# Raiku Simulator Developer Guide

## Overview

The `raiku-simulator` is a Rust-based backend application designed to simulate a marketplace for transaction slot auctions. It supports two types of auctions:
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Auctions**: For transactions that need to be included in the very next available slot.
- **Ahead-of-Time (AoT) Auctions**: For transactions that are scheduled for future slots, allowing for a bidding period.

The simulator provides a RESTful API for interacting with the marketplace, managing user sessions, submitting bids, and querying the state of slots and transactions. It also includes a Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint for real-time updates on marketplace activities.

## Architecture

The `raiku-simulator` is built using the `axum` web framework and `tokio` for asynchronous runtime. It employs a layered architecture with a central `AppState` managing various concurrent components using `Arc<RwLock<T>>` for thread-safe access to shared mutable data.

**Key Architectural Principles:**
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Leverages `tokio` for efficient handling of concurrent operations, including API requests, scheduled tasks, and event broadcasting.
- **Shared State Management**: `AppState` acts as the single source of truth, providing controlled access to core components like the marketplace, auction manager, and transaction store.
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Uses an `EventBroadcaster` to disseminate significant application events, enabling real-time updates to connected clients via SSE.
- **Modular Design**: The codebase is organized into distinct modules, each responsible for a specific domain (e.g., `api`, `state`, `auction`, `session`, `slot`, `transaction`, `events`, `rate_limiter`, `config`).

## Module Breakdown

### `main.rs`
The application's entry point. It handles:
- Initialization of logging.
- Loading application configuration from environment variables.
- Setting up the `AppState` and `RateLimiter`.
- Spawning background `tokio` tasks for:
    - Periodically advancing the slot and resolving JIT/AoT auctions.
    - Cleaning up expired user sessions.
- Configuring and starting the `axum` HTTP server.

### `lib.rs`
The library root that re-exports all public modules and defines common enums:
- `InclusionType`: Differentiates between JIT and AoT transaction inclusion.
- `TransactionType`: Distinguishes between JIT and AoT transactions.

### `api.rs`
Defines the REST API endpoints and their handlers.
- **`AppContext`**: A struct holding `AppState`, `Config`, and `RateLimiter`, passed as application state to API handlers.
- **Routes**: Configures all API routes for sessions, marketplace status, slots, auctions, transactions, and health checks.
- **Middleware**: Integrates rate limiting and CORS policies.

### `state.rs`
Manages the global application state and provides methods for interacting with core components.
- **`AppState`**: Contains `Arc<RwLock<T>>` wrappers for:
    - `SlotMarketplace`: Manages the state of all transaction slots.
    - `AuctionManager`: Handles JIT and AoT auction logic.
    - `HashMap<String, Transaction>`: Stores all transactions by ID.
    - `HashMap<String, Vec<String>>`: Maps session IDs to their transaction IDs.
    - `SessionManager`: Manages user sessions.
    - `EventBroadcaster`: Publishes application events.
- **Core Logic**: Provides high-level methods for adding/updating transactions, advancing slots, retrieving marketplace statistics, starting auctions, and submitting bids.

### `auction.rs`
Implements the logic for Just-in-Time (JIT) and Ahead-of-Time (AoT) auctions.
- **`Bid`**: Represents a bid placed by a user for a slot.
- **`JiTAuction`**: Handles bids for the very next slot, with a simple highest-bid-wins mechanism.
- **`AoTAuction`**: Manages auctions for future slots, including a bidding period and resolution logic based on time or slot advancement.
- **`AuctionManager`**: Stores and manages active JIT and AoT auctions, providing methods to start, submit bids, and resolve them.

### `session.rs`
Manages user sessions for API interaction.
- **`Session`**: Represents an individual user session with an ID, creation time, last active time, and expiration time.
- **`SessionManager`**: Provides functionality to create new sessions, retrieve and validate existing sessions (extending their expiry on activity), and clean up expired sessions.

### `events.rs`
Provides a publish-subscribe mechanism for application events.
- **`AppEvent`**: An enum enumerating all possible events within the simulator (e.g., slot advanced, auction started, bid submitted, transaction updated, marketplace stats). These events are serializable for SSE.
- **`EventBroadcaster`**: Allows components to broadcast events and provides `Receiver`s for subscribers (like the `/events` SSE endpoint).

### `rate_limiter.rs`
Implements API rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- **`RateLimiter`**: Uses a `DashMap` of `TokenBucket`s to track request counts per client IP within a sliding window.
- **`TokenBucket`**: Stores rate limiting state for a single client, including tokens, last refill time, and request count.
- **`rate_limit_middleware`**: An `axum` middleware function that intercepts incoming requests, checks against the rate limit, and blocks requests if the limit is exceeded.

### `slot.rs`
Manages the concept of "slots" â€“ discrete blockspace units in which transactions can be included.
- **`SlotState`**: An enum representing the current state of a slot (e.g., `Available`, `JiTAuction`, `AoTAuction`, `Reserved`, `Filled`, `Expired`).
- **`Slot`**: Represents a single slot, including its number, state, estimated time, base fee, and compute unit availability/usage.
- **`SlotMarketplace`**: Holds and manages a collection of `Slot`s, tracks the `current_slot`, and handles advancing the slot. It initializes a rolling window of upcoming slots.

### `transaction.rs`
Defines the structure and lifecycle of a transaction.
- **`TransactionStatus`**: An enum tracking the status of a transaction (e.g., `Pending`, `Included`, `Failed`, `AuctionWon`).
- **`Transaction`**: Contains details such as ID, sender, inclusion type, current status, compute units, priority fee (bid amount), and timestamps. Provides methods to create JIT/AoT transactions and update their status.

### `config.rs`
Handles application configuration, primarily loading settings from environment variables.
- **`Config`**: The main configuration struct, composed of:
    - `ServerConfig`: HTTP server settings (host, port, CORS origins).
    - `MarketplaceConfig`: Marketplace-specific settings (slot duration, base fee, slot advance interval).
    - `AuctionConfig`: Auction-specific settings (AoT default duration).
- **`from_env()`**: A constructor that reads environment variables, applying default values if not present, and parses them into the configuration structs.

## 4. API Endpoints

All API endpoints are prefixed with the server host and port (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
