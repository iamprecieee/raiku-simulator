# Use Case Demonstrations

## Scenario 1: High-Frequency Trading Firm

### Context
A trading firm executes arbitrage strategies across multiple DEXs on Solana. During high volatility, transaction failure rates spike, causing missed opportunities and wasted compute fees.

### Demonstration Steps
1. Load the simulator web application in browser
2. Click "Submit JIT Bid" button
3. Enter bid amount exceeding current minimum
4. Transaction appears in pending state
5. Watch slot advance and auction resolve
6. Transaction moves to "Auction Won" state
7. Balance decreases by bid amount
8. View transaction details showing exact slot inclusion

## Scenario 2: Institutional Settlement

### Context
An institutional trading desk needs to settle positions at specific times for regulatory reporting. Traditional transaction submission cannot guarantee execution at required timestamps.

### Demonstration Steps
1. Navigate to marketplace tab
2. Identify future slot matching settlement time
3. Click on slot to submit AOT bid
4. Enter bid amount (can start at minimum)
5. Observe auction countdown timer
6. Submit additional bids if outbid
7. Watch auction resolve when timer expires
8. Transaction guaranteed for reserved slot
9. If outbid, automatic refund to balance

## Scenario 3: DeFi Liquidation Bot

### Context
A liquidation bot monitors under-collateralized positions and must execute liquidations before positions become insolvent. Failed liquidations result in bad debt for protocols.

### Demonstration Steps
1. Open simulator and note current balance
2. Simulate urgent liquidation via JIT bid
3. Enter high bid amount for certainty
4. Submit and watch pending status
5. Observe slot advance within 400ms
6. Auction resolves to highest bidder
